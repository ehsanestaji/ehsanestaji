In this domain, my research themes include:
- Graphs associated with algebraic structures
- Metric dimension of graphs
- Studying symmetry in graphs

**Selected Publications**
- **Paper Title A**: Published in Journal XYZ, Year. [[PDF](https://link-to-paper.com)]
- **Paper Title B**: Published in Journal MNO, Year. [[PDF](https://link-to-paper.com)]

**Ongoing Research**
- **Research Project A**: Description and technologies used.

### 🗳 E-Voting and Information Security (Related to Second PhD)
My work in this domain is centered around:
- Individual verification in e-voting systems
- Utilizing machine learning and data science to predict models for national level elections

**Selected Publications**
- **Paper Title 1**: Published in Journal DEF, Year. [[PDF](https://link-to-paper.com)]
