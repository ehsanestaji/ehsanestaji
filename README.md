## üìä Portfolio & Industry Engagements

Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm also deeply engaged in applying my skills in an industrial context. I have successfully completed Google's extensive program for Data Analyst Certification. I work on various projects outside my academic life to apply my strong mathematical and computational foundation to real-world issues.

**Projects**

- **[Exploratory Data Analysis (Star Wars Survey)](https://github.com/ehsanestaji/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA)**: In-depth analysis of a Star Wars survey dataset to glean comprehensive insights into fans' preferences.
  - **Description**: Conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis on a survey dataset containing responses from Star Wars fans. The analysis aimed to discover intricate patterns and insights related to fans' preferences concerning movies, characters, and plot points.
  - **Findings**: Uncovered key insights into the popularity of various Star Wars episodes, the divide in fan opinions on certain characters, and the significance of the plot points that most resonate with the audience.
  - **Visualizations**: Employed various types of visualizations including bar plots, heatmaps, and pie charts to better understand the dataset and to visually represent the findings.
  - **Technologies**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- **[Predictive Modeling in Healthcare](https://github.com/ehsanestaji/PredictiveMLClassifier)**: Leveraging machine learning to predict complications during hospitalization.
    - **Description**: Developed a robust machine learning classifier to predict the occurrence of complications in hospitalized patients. Utilized an extensive dataset encompassing various patient details and surgical timings. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.
    - **Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
    - **Metrics**: Achieved an accuracy of 95% with XGBoost, and explored model interpretability through SHAP values and feature importances.
    - **Technologies**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
 


- **[Protein Classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)](https://github.com/ehsanestaji/Protein-Classification-GNN/tree/main)**: Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for classifying proteins. The model can distinguish between enzyme and non-enzyme proteins, leveraging the capabilities of GNNs for an efficient and accurate classification.

    - **Models**: Graph Neural Network, Graph Convolutional Neural Network
    -  **Metrics**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.33%.
    -  **Technologies**: PyTorch, BioPython, NetworkX, PyViz, scikit-learn
