- Metric dimension of graphs
- Studying symmetry in graphs

**Selected Publications**
- **Distinguishing cartesian products of countable graphs**:[[PDF](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pilsniak/24.pdf)]
- **Moore–Penrose inverse of incidence matrix of graphs with complete and cyclic blocks**: [[PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X18303145)]
- **The strong metric dimension of generalized Sierpi´nski graphs with pendant vertices**: [[PDF](https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/article/view/813)]
- **Wiener index of certain families of hexagonal chains**: [[PDF](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12190-018-1177-9)]
- **On the unit graph of a non-commutative ring**: [[PDF](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S100538671500070X)]


### 🗳 E-Voting and Information Security (Related to Second PhD)
My work in this domain is centered around:
- Individual verification in e-voting systems
- Utilizing machine learning and data science to predict models for national level elections

**Selected Publications**
- **Revisiting practical and usable coercion-resistant remote e-voting**: [[PDF](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-60347-2_4)]
